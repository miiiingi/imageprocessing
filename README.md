# imageprocessing

### This repository contains the code-implementation that I did while taking a graduate lecture related to image-process.  
### These codes, I think, contain the basic and necessary element of image processing.  
### Task1 relates implementation of lane detection algorithm using RANSAC.  
### Task2 relates implementation of a basic image-processing method such as applying a filter, equalizing a histogram, edge detection.
